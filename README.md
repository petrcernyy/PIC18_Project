# PIC18_Project

An university project that demonstrates a usage of general peripherals in embedded. The project was written for developement board created by university specifically for this course. 

1. **GPIO**: Toggling a set of LEDs on and off.
2. **UART Communication**: Receiving a message from a PC, reversing it, and sending it back.
3. **PWM**: Adjusting the brightness of an LED using Pulse Width Modulation.
4. **ADC**: Reading values from two potentiometers and displaying values.
5. **DAC**: Generating a triangular signal with a Digital-to-Analog Converter.
6. **Simple Timing Game**: A game where the user presses a button, a number in seconds is displayed, and the user has to guess the elapsed time.
7. **Piezo Speaker Music**: Playing a melody using an external piezo speaker.
